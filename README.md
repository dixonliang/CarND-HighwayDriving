# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
   
### Overview
This is a summary of my code for the Path Planning Project for the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program. For this project, we were to design a path planner that is able to create a smooth and safe path for a car in a simulated three lane highway. The main criteria were to make sure to follow the speed limit, avoid collisions, and maintain a comfortable acceleration / jerk. 

### Initialization
We begin with the localization of the car's data which is given as a template, using a Frenet coordinate system. All other vehicles are read in using sensor fusion. 

```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```
`mkdir build && cd build`

### Path (Speed and Acceleration)



### Avoid Collisions
We check through the sensor fusion data to check if there are any cars within our lane, left, and right lane. 



### Lane Changes
